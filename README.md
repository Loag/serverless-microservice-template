## About:
I'm a huge fan of serverless computing. However there aren't any templates or tutorials I think go far enough for a complete beginner.
This template tries to solve that. 

## Before going any further:
I would highly recommend anyone interested in using this template to check out this [repo](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-com)
by [Anomaly Innovations](http://anoma.ly/) as this template is heavily influenced by their fantastic work.
